//! Measured equipment supply backing [`crate::probability`].
//!
//! How much equipment a floor produces, and how it splits over upgrades,
//! curses, enchantments, and tiers, is an emergent property of room decks,
//! chest budgets, and quest placement rather than a constant that can be read
//! off the upstream source. The numbers below are therefore sampled
//! from the canonical generator by
//! `cargo run --release --example calibrate_probability`, and
//! `tests/probability_tables.rs` re-measures a smaller sample to catch drift.
//!
//! This module owns the shape of that data; the generated file owns the
//! values.
