//! Query probability estimates derived from the measured v3.3.8 item supply.
//!
//! The estimate answers "what fraction of seeds satisfies this query", not "how
//! likely is one item to match", so it has to know how much equipment a run
//! actually offers. That supply lives in [`crate::probability_tables`]: expected
//! reward slots per floor and source, with the upgrade, curse, enchantment, and
//! tier distributions each source produces.
//!
//! Every requirement becomes a filter over those slots. Floor limits carve the
//! dungeon into stretches, each holding its own supply, so two items wanted by
//! floor four compete over what those four floors offer rather than over the
//! whole run. Within a stretch a line's slots arrive as a run of independent
//! chances rather than a Poisson process, because the generator deals item
//! categories from a decrementing deck, and they all come out of that one run —
//! which is what stops two requirements from each being handed an item when only
//! one was ever produced. A shop places a fixed number of slots on a single
//! floor instead, and a shelf holding mutually exclusive stock counts once,
//! since a run can only carry one of them out.
//!
//! Requirements are then matched one-to-one onto slots, so three wands are not
//! scored as one wand three times and one shelf is not spent twice. Requirements
//! linked to one identity are summed over the identities they could share and
//! resolved alongside the rest of their family, discounted by the deck-driven
//! scarcity of duplicates.
//!
//! A slot's tier and its upgrade level are tabled apart and multiplied, which
//! holds wherever the generator rolls them apart. The Imp's two hoards do not:
//! its vault stocks four fixed shelves and its reward flips a coin over which
//! of two weapons is levelled furthest, so at both a tier names the levels it
//! can carry — including the `+5` that only ever lands on a tier-4 weapon.
//! Those sources carry a measured upgrade-per-tier table instead, and are
//! scored against it; every other source multiplies its two marginals.
//!
//! Quest prizes are not supply like that, and they are the whole reason
//! families cannot be resolved apart. A giver lays out a pool spanning every
//! family — the Imp's five reward options beside its vault's treasure rooms —
//! and the player carries exactly one item away, so the Imp's haul can answer
//! the `+4` ring a query wants or its `+3` armor, never both. Each pool is
//! therefore lifted out of the per-family matching and spent once across the
//! whole query, on whichever requirement it reaches that helps most.
//!
//! Known simplifications: challenges shift item placement but are ignored, and
//! a query carrying more requirements than one matching resolves keeps only its
//! scarcest ones, which read high. Against them, a pool is spent on its single
//! best use rather than on whichever of them the seed left open; a pool that
//! reaches two unrelated requirements is read as reaching the easier whenever
//! it reaches the harder, which understates how often it ends up spent on the
//! lesser; and duplicate scarcity is measured over a whole line at once, so a
//! linked group whose members want very different items — one `+3` alongside
//! two plain ones — is discounted as heavily as one wanting three alike. Those
//! read low.
