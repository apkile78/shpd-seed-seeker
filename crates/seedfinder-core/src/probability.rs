//! Query probability estimates derived from the measured v3.3.8 item supply.
//!
//! The estimate answers "what fraction of seeds satisfies this query", not "how
//! likely is one item to match", so it has to know how much equipment a run
//! actually offers. That supply lives in [`crate::probability_tables`]: expected
//! reward slots per floor and source, with the upgrade, curse, enchantment, and
//! tier distributions each source produces.
//!
//! Every requirement becomes a filter over those slots. Floor limits carve the
//! dungeon into stretches, each holding its own supply, so two items wanted by
//! floor four compete over what those four floors offer rather than over the
//! whole run. Within a stretch a line's slots arrive as a run of independent
//! chances rather than a Poisson process, because the generator deals item
//! categories from a decrementing deck, and they all come out of that one run —
//! which is what stops two requirements from each being handed an item when only
//! one was ever produced. Quests and shops place a fixed number of slots on a
//! single floor instead, and a slot holding mutually exclusive prizes counts
//! once, since a run can only carry one of them out.
//!
//! Requirements are then matched one-to-one onto slots, so three wands are not
//! scored as one wand three times and the Wandmaker's single prize is not spent
//! twice. Requirements linked to one identity are summed over the identities
//! they could share and resolved alongside the rest of their family, discounted
//! by the deck-driven scarcity of duplicates.
//!
//! Known simplifications: challenges shift item placement but are ignored;
//! rewards that exclude one another across families, like the Ghost's
//! weapon-or-armor choice, are counted as independently obtainable; and a family
//! carrying more requirements than one matching resolves keeps only its scarcest
//! ones. Those make the estimate optimistic. Against them, duplicate scarcity is
//! measured over a whole line at once, so a linked group whose members want very
//! different items — one `+3` alongside two plain ones — is discounted as
//! heavily as one wanting three alike, and reads low.
