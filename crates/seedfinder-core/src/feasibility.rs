//! Logic-based query feasibility: which sources can satisfy each requirement,
//! how deep generation must run, and when a partially generated seed can be
//! abandoned early.
//!
//! The rules here mirror structural facts of the v3.3.8 generator:
//!
//! - Natural equipment rolls never exceed +2 ([`crate::equipment`]), so +3
//!   weapons come only from the Sacrificial-fire room, the Ghost quest, the
//!   Blacksmith, or a special-room chest prize (the flooded-vault and sentry
//!   rooms bump a weapon, missile, or armor roll by one, and the secret maze
//!   bumps a melee weapon or armor roll — all dropped as chests); +3 armor
//!   only from the Crypt, the Ghost, the Blacksmith, or those same chest
//!   prizes; +3 wands only from the Wandmaker; and +3/+4 rings only from the
//!   Imp.
//! - Every quest resolves inside a fixed depth window (Ghost 2–4, Wandmaker
//!   7–9, Blacksmith 12–14, Imp 17–19) and spawns at most once per run, with
//!   the spawn forced on the window's final floor.
//! - Shops stock unupgraded, unenchanted items only, and quest reward choices
//!   are mutually exclusive, so each quest satisfies at most one requirement.
//!
//! Everything derived from these rules is exact: a rejected seed can never
//! match, and a shortened generation depth can never hide a match. The one
//! deliberately lossy refinement is [`SearchQuery::fast_mode`], which ignores
//! the rare Crypt/Sacrificial-fire/chest-prize +3 rolls so that +3
//! weapon/armor requirements become quest-only and inherit the Blacksmith's
//! depth-14 deadline.
//!
//! The searchable catalog contains equipment only. `NO_SCROLLS` halves the
//! scheduled Scroll of Upgrade drops, but no current requirement can target a
//! consumable or torch, so there is no challenge-dependent availability bound
//! to apply here. Its RNG knock-on effects are handled by generation itself.
