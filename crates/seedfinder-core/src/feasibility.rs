//! Logic-based query feasibility: which sources can satisfy each requirement,
//! how deep generation must run, and when a partially generated seed can be
//! abandoned early.
//!
//! The rules here mirror structural facts of the v4.0.0 generator:
//!
//! - Natural equipment rolls never exceed +2 ([`crate::equipment`]), so +3
//!   weapons come only from the Sacrificial-fire room, the Ghost quest, the
//!   Blacksmith, a special-room chest prize (the flooded-vault and sentry
//!   rooms bump a weapon, missile, or armor roll by one, and the secret maze
//!   bumps a melee weapon or armor roll — all dropped as chests), or the Imp;
//!   +3 armor only from the Crypt, the Ghost, the Blacksmith, those same
//!   chest prizes, or the Imp; +3 wands only from the Wandmaker or the Imp;
//!   and +3 rings only from the Imp.
//! - Everything above +3 is the Imp's alone. On its City floor the quest
//!   rolls six prizes ([`ItemSource::ImpReward`]: an artifact or ring, a
//!   ring, a tier-5 weapon with a tier-4 thrown weapon or the reverse, plate
//!   armor, and a wand — +2..+4, the tier-4 weapons +3..+5, never cursed,
//!   every weapon and armor carrying a good enchantment or glyph) and opens a
//!   vault whose treasure rooms hold [`ItemSource::VaultTreasure`] equipment
//!   (+0..+3 plus one +4 tier-4 melee weapon, never cursed, effects good or
//!   absent). They are the only sources of +4 armor, wands and rings and of
//!   +4/+5 weapons, and because the player carries exactly one item out of
//!   the vault, both sources together are one mutually exclusive choice —
//!   one [`Quest::Imp`] pick.
//! - Every quest resolves inside a fixed depth window (Ghost 2–4, Wandmaker
//!   7–9, Blacksmith 12–14, Imp 17–19) and spawns at most once per run, with
//!   the spawn forced on the window's final floor.
//! - Shops stock unupgraded, unenchanted items only, and quest reward choices
//!   are mutually exclusive, so each quest satisfies at most one requirement.
//!
//! Everything derived from these rules is exact: a rejected seed can never
//! match, and a shortened generation depth can never hide a match.
//!
//! The searchable catalog contains equipment only. `NO_SCROLLS` halves the
//! scheduled Scroll of Upgrade drops, but no current requirement can target a
//! consumable or torch, so there is no challenge-dependent availability bound
//! to apply here. Its RNG knock-on effects are handled by generation itself.
